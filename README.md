## Automated development builds

The following builds are build automatically by our build servers after each push to the [develop](http://www.paybf.com/) branch.

## Building the source

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the
[Installation Instructions](https://github.com/pbfcoin/go-pbfcoin/wiki/Building-pbfcoin)
on the wiki.

Building gpbf requires two external dependencies, Go and GMP.
You can install them using your favourite package manager.
Once the dependencies are installed, run

    make gpbf

## Executables

Go pbfcoin comes with several wrappers/executables found in 
[the `cmd` directory](https://github.com/pbfcoin/go-pbfcoin/tree/develop/cmd):

 Command  |         |
----------|---------|
`gpbf` | pbfcoin CLI (pbfcoin command line interface client) |
`bootnode` | runs a bootstrap node for the Discovery Protocol |
`pbftest` | test tool which runs with the [tests](https://github.com/pbfcoin/tests) suite: `/path/to/test.json > pbftest --test BlockTests --stdin`.
`evm` | is a generic pbfcoin Virtual Machine: `evm -code 60ff60ff -gas 10000 -price 0 -dump`. See `-h` for a detailed description. |
`disasm` | disassembles EVM code: `echo "6001" | disasm` |
`rlpdump` | prints RLP structures |

#### Defining the private genesis state
ps:It was modified based on Go-Ethereum. Official Golang implementation of the pbfcoin protocol.
First, you'll need to create the genesis state of your networks, which all nodes need to be
aware of and agree upon. This consists of a small JSON file (e.g. call it `genesis.json`):

```json
{
  "config": {
    "chainId": <arbitrary positive integer>,
    "homesteadBlock": 0,
    "eip150Block": 0,
    "eip155Block": 0,
    "eip158Block": 0,
    "byzantiumBlock": 0,
    "constantinopleBlock": 0,
    "petersburgBlock": 0
  },
  "alloc": {},
  "coinbase": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "difficulty": "0x20000",
  "extraData": "",
  "gasLimit": "0x2fefd8",
  "nonce": "0x0000000000000042",
  "mixhash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "parentHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "timestamp": "0x00"
}
```

The above fields should be fine for most purposes, although we'd recommend changing
the `nonce` to some random value so you prevent unknown remote nodes from being able
to connect to you. If you'd like to pre-fund some accounts for easier testing, create
the accounts and populate the `alloc` field with their addresses.

```json
"alloc": {
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001": {
    "balance": "111111111"
  },
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002": {
    "balance": "222222222"
  }
}
```

With the genesis state defined in the above JSON file, you'll need to initialize **every**
`gpbf` node with it prior to starting it up to ensure all blockchain parameters are correctly
set:

```shell
$ gpbf init path/to/genesis.json
```

#### Creating the rendezvous point

With all nodes that you want to run initialized to the desired genesis state, you'll need to
start a bootstrap node that others can use to find each other in your network and/or over
the internet. The clean way is to configure and run a dedicated bootnode:

```shell
$ bootnode --genkey=boot.key
$ bootnode --nodekey=boot.key
```

With the bootnode online, it will display an [`enode` URL](https://github.com/pbfcoin/go-pbfcoin/wiki/Building-pbfcoin)
that other nodes can use to connect to it and exchange peer information. Make sure to
replace the displayed IP address information (most probably `[::]`) with your externally
accessible IP to get the actual `enode` URL.

*Note: You could also use a full-fledged `gpbf` node as a bootnode, but it's the less
recommended way.*

#### Starting up your member nodes

With the bootnode operational and externally reachable (you can try
`telnet <ip> <port>` to ensure it's indeed reachable), start every subsequent `gpbf`
node pointed to the bootnode for peer discovery via the `--bootnodes` flag. It will
probably also be desirable to keep the data directory of your private network separated, so
do also specify a custom `--datadir` flag.

```shell
$ gpbf --datadir=path/to/custom/data/folder --bootnodes=<bootnode-enode-url-from-above>
```

*Note: Since your network will be completely cut off from the main and test networks, you'll
also need to configure a miner to process transactions and create new blocks for you.*
## Command line options

`gpbf` can be configured via command line options, environment variables and config files.

To get the options available:

    gpbf help
